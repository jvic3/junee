<h1>CAR RENTAL SYSTEM</h1>
<p>Many travelers take renting a car for granted especially during the pandemic when isolation is a priority. Customers prefer convenient and timely service, but it's not uncommon for car rentals to lag. Roughly speaking, vehicle pick-ups delay every third time. Considering the tight competition in this business landscape, car rental services canâ€™t fail to satisfy their customers.
If a driver decides to rent a car beforehand, they go to a car rental website or app and find a vehicle that meets their needs. Then, they book it and pay for the chosen rental period, if upfront payment is required.

On the appointed day, this customer arrives at the car rental location to pick up the chosen car. An agent makes copies of their IDs, explains the terms of the lease, instructs them on any special features of the car, and finally hands them the keys. When the customer drops off the car, the agent checks its mileage and inspects for any damages.</p>
